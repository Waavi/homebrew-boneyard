# Homebrew Boneyard

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/rjcoelho/homebrew-boneyard.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/rjcoelho/homebrew-boneyard)

Repos with homebrew formulas that not avaliable elsewhere.

Created using [How to create and maintain a tap](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/blob/master/docs/How-to-Create-and-Maintain-a-Tap.md).

## How do I install these formulae?

Just `brew tap rjcoelho/boneyard` and then `brew install <formula>`.

If the formula conflicts with one from Homebrew/homebrew or another tap, you can `brew install rjcoelho/boneyard/<formula>`.

You can also install via URL:

```
brew install https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rjcoelho/homebrew-boneyard/master/<formula>.rb
```
